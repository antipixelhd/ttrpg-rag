# Planning
## Organisatorisches

- [ ] For me: If deadline to stop -> mention it ingame to speed things along for cliffhanger!

- [x] healing potions!! 
- [x]  Explain Skill challenge again (during recap)
	- [x] Its about achieving a certain goal as a group
		- [x] nobody can succeed on their own
	- [x] its not about picking your best modifier and rolling with it, its about creating a narrative moment aided by the dice rolls
		- [ ] the more your action aligns with the narrative, or RP the easier the DC / maybe advantage
	- [x] Example [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]], everyone thought about just the end goal
		- [x] could also helped each other, spell or otherwise boosting forward
- [x] Added [[Pins of Wall of Force]] to dnd beyond

---
- [ ] Don't make negative assumptions about player interpretations -> STAY POSITIVE -> Have fun!!!
- [ ] Describe more senses
- [ ] Describe age of NPCs

## [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] Resurrection
- [x] First ask Lars if [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] is willing to return....
### Regardless of outcome
- Ask lars if he accepts the dream world!!
	- will spend days months in there
- Vorak rejects dream
	- turns his back to his partens....
		- skeletal hand on his shoulders!!!
	- sees necromancer that killed his parents
		- (raspy voice) "Ihre Seelen haben meinem meister geschmeckt"
	- VORAK TURN
	- (then remembers attack)
- Vorak accepts dream
	- ask lars what they do
### Ritual success

- Vorak accepts the dream world
	- Outside: Sai brings the soul back to body......but he doesn't wake up, his heart is not beating
		- Ask what he does
			- BRING IN SAI!! -> let him roleplay/talk

- Then remembers the attack
	- The scenery verändert sich....brennende Hütten, Leichen überall 
	- Du erinnerst dich zurück, zurück zu dem Moment wo du deine Eltern tot vor dir gesehen hast. Ihre Seelen für immer vernichtet. Und dir wird bewusst, dass alles was du bis jetzt gesehen hast nicht echt ist.
	- [!] PLAY HE COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN
	- Du erinnerst dich an den ZORN den du verspürt hast, die WUT die dir alle sinne geraubt hat....Und eine kleine Erinnerung kommt zu dir zurück....
	- Das du an jenem Tag nicht gerettet wurdest, niemand hat dich beschützt, denn du bist mit dem nächsten Angriff gestorben
	- ....DOCH....die Wut blieb, sie blieb weiter und weiter....du siehst den Champion nicken und sich dann umdrehen.....seit jenem Moment hast du silberne Augen und hörst Stimmen die dich noch bis Heute verfolgen
	- Deine Aufgabe ist noch nicht erfüllt, nicht bis ER vernichtet ist.
- Wakes up, muscle tense, eyes bloodshot, raging 
	- wie als würde er ragend von dem Tot auferstehen
- Normally u play a sad ost in a resurrection, but not for Vorak
### Ritual failure
- [ ] Ask Lars if he wants to narrate Voraks final scene in this campaign
	- [ ] Does he accept this dream or does he face reality?
		- Reality: Thread of Fate....Led to [[The Raven Queen, Matron of Death|Raven Queen]] 
	- looks back to his accomplishments, the victories
		- knows his friends will carry on 
- [ ] Idea if he accepts dream
	- Play THE END ost
	- sky break and beautiful day
	- Group of 5 approaching the settlement, staying there for a while
		- They all get along very well
		- then asking if Vorak wants to go on a adventure

		- [ ] Once inside: hears gears turning (click click click)
	- Random family is inside who got paid to have symbol there
	- [ ] If [[Main Party]] comes
		- [ ] [[The Child]] is also in entrance hall! -> has mask but also disguise self up!!

	- Maybe first [[The Veiled Five]] to test them, if they can be trusted they get audience
