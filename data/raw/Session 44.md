# Summary


- [ ] Put non gathered [[Cael Morrow]] items into [[Netherdeep]] (in case they fit)
	- [ ] Mainly the dimension door cape, but otherwise dont (punish for not exploring everything)

- [ ] Tie all "time related" things together using [Hacking to the gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sTMZ2vZ5-I) (could be when eve goes back in time, but also just as campaign ending)
	- Using different steins gate ost first and finish with eve hacking to the gate also works
		- Should probably keep eves scene with unique ost (could also be steiner)
	- [ ] Things to show
		- Alyxian meeting his friends -> mirroring party, "him" saying we meet again...
			- Then his FRIENDS fighting with him and defending past [[Cael Morrow]] 
			- One saying to keep having hope (whatever til said)
		- Alyxian just before getting third blessing answering questions...then party answering the same
		- New scene: Alyxian praying to the moonweavering he doesnt want to be alone, is afraid to be alone (then receiving perigee). 
			- Then alyxian screeming against storm. Then alyxian alone in the dark beaten by gruumsh, praying to the gods to save him...
			- Amulet flying across Exandria to the first prayer site!
		- Lafthal awakening Alyian, pictures across exandria (prayer sites, footsteps of alyxian) now emitting red glow, and growing Ruidium, Ruidium expanding everywhere
			- Lafthal sinking and awakening on some shore
			- Moonweavering asking him for help
		- Alyxian seeing the future, the same as the party saw, a future where the world is destroyed
			- Reveal: in the distant its a angel flying alyxian himself
		- Then finish with the Eve reveal!
- [ ] Future steins gate plot: they want/have to go back to the "original timeline"
	- not literally, just undoing the changes they made
	- Cause: [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] is DEAD!
- [[The Veiled Five]]
	- [ ] Will [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] invite back and brainstorm on ways to turn back time further??
		- [ ] Beacon -> [[Rosohna]]
	- [ ] [[The Judge]]: wants selene to help him turn back time to undo his choice, veiled five never get created and selene gets to live with her mother
	- [ ] [[The Judge]]: Maybe is interested in [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] because he revives so many people? 
		- [ ] Plan to go back to Material Plane: get killed and revived? (only works if he can revive without body!!)
- [ ] if [[Selene Noctis (Til)|Selene]] didnt see her own face for YEEEAARS (suggest it before til answers)
	- could do plottwist: selene is in luceris body 
		- maybe explanation is: the mask warped her body to be similar (the judge wants to bring her back to life)
- [ ] Could have [[The Veil]] "hack" the [[Golems]] so they obbey "the king", and no longer [[J'mon Sa Ord]]
	- [ ] Maybe they influenced creation and they are programmed to always obbey king, so if king changes [[J'mon Sa Ord]] cant prove themselves!

- [ ] Complete [[Xal'thul]] statblock!

- [ ] Next Session 0:
	- [ ] Want a party working with each other not against
	- [ ] I want that each players know what the others intentions are with the character, its easier to fit yours in. Not like last time where everyone is isolated


- [ ] Unused [[Aboleth (Alyxian)#Telepathic Messages]] go to dialogue in [[Netherdeep]]!!
