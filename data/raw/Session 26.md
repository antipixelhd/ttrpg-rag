	- [ ] Further could have him suggest, that he will free himself once he is powerful enough
	- [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] showed the diamond, but the "curse" was gone, but the diamond seemed magical 
		- [ ] later sold it for 1000g at [[Bibbity Bobbity]]
		- [ ] [[Xal'thul]] succeeded in choosing the diamond as his next phylactery
	- [ ] offered they could send it to Vasselheim, party suggested to get somebody from there here?
		- likely not, people don't want to leave that place!
		- maybe find another priest who could help?
	- [ ] [[Balsahar]], friend of [[Jamil A'alithiya]] who died because he fought his patron!
	- [ ] next time he will excuse himself for not helping more but was too afraid to cause more damage

		- Ordered Katana to be made for [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]
		- Got approval for [[Blessing Well]]

		- [ ] Still research open
	- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]
		- [[Bibbity Bobbity]] job -> 30g

		- woke up once in very high room, heard one more voice beside [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]]


- [ ] [[Bibbity Bobbity]] could be one of the leaders of [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]]
	- but doesnt make sense, why would he have so much money that he doesnt give them
	- Could be connected to [[The Veil]] tho!!
- [ ] Setup ideas on how they could free [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]]
	- If they kill [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]], [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] dies?!, -> referencing [[Jamil A'alithiya]] 
		- Can obv revive but would be unexpected
- [ ] Dropped sai the lore that [[Blessing Well]] was supposedly created by a god crying for a mortal
	- change it so its not true, the tale is that a god cried but for whom is unknown. [[Avandra, The Change Bringer]] was the one concerned but that was way earlier
- [ ] balance mask more, maybe change visuals, that now it just goes black and not the helmet of [[Xal'thul]]
- [ ] [[Jamil A'alithiya]] gave kinda bad reasoning for not "knowing" anything about the excavation
	- he said "dont know anything because the allegiance is keeping everything secret"
	- in reality come up with different reasoning, maybe that he knows more but did not want to reveal specifics
	- they did not show the [[Ruidium]] yet!!
	- He knows not too much because he has only been high curator for X years, other one went to Wildemount, there are talks that they want to establish a branch in [[Xhorhas]], [[Rosohna]]
- [ ] Do OST channel, and send named osts 
- [ ] [[Maroon 5]] did first quest for [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream|Consortium]], but for different leader. Maybe [[Gamila]] mentioned to them that [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] is currently busy, so she asigned them to X
- [ ] Melli might not be gone for too long?
	- [ ] could do dream before she wakes up for real
	- [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] doesnt want to raise too much suspicion
	- Maybe she tells her "If you want to help the Consortium, funding is a big problem right now, and/or. Die Eule hätte bestimmt nichts dagegen Aushilfe zu haben, Gamila würde sich bestimmt um euch kümmern, was sagst du?"
		- Maybe have her return not that late,
			- [[Satzrak Runestrider]], could drop "Und wie lief es, was hattest du mit der Motte zu tun"
			- Calculate if she has enough spells to go back and forth!
- [ ] Still gotta solve where they stay!
- [ ] [[Vaelistra Zaphyr|Vaelistra Zaphyr]] saved again, [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] will approach [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]]
- [ ] [[Jamil A'alithiya]] could give amulet of [[protection-from-evil-and-good]] to [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] once they are members of the [[Cobalt Soul]], its something he found after his friend dying
- [ ] design [[Asmutayya]] lair action for damage
	- maybe summon statues 1d6 per round, dont make it too similar to [[Xal'thul]]!!!
- [ ] Roll for beard
- [ ] look into beholder lair, maybe have [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] and [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] be getting the feeling of "getting followed"
- [ ] [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] will approach [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] to get any connecting peace to her mother
	- Ring/dagger could work
	- only if he fails one more time
- [ ] [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] could ask [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] for a job (to join [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]])
	- Only do it if [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] doesnt soon contact her

- [ ] [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] breaking contract means that his father dies ([[Xal'thul]] will threaten)
- [ ] party goal is to kill/destroy [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]]
	- [[Cobalt Soul]] will be against it -> need to gather evidence. Once they have (cobalt soul) the party can act. But first they have to prove themselves!

- [ ] Daniel, Wants to contact [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream|Consortium]] to get help to beat [[Xal'thul]] or destroy blade?,
