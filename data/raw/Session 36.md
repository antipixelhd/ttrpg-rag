		- but his essence escaped to the [[Far Realm]] [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]] 

- [ ] Vorak +1 [[Ruidium Corruption]]
- [ ] (add to pre session) Explain Skill challenge again
	- [ ] Its about achieving a certain goal as a group
		- [ ] nobody can succeed on their own
	- [ ] its not about picking your best modifier and rolling with it, its about creating a narrative moment aided by the dice rolls
		- [ ] the more your action aligns with the narrative, or RP the easier the DC / maybe advantage
	- [ ] Example [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]], everyone thought about just the end goal
		- [ ] could also helped each other, spell or otherwise boosting forward 
- [ ] mention in recap:
	- [ ] Melli got hit with the same static feedback as Eve when she tried to read her thoughts
	- [ ] [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] couldnt use the amulet on himself, as it is only meant for others....why is it like this
- [ ] Have a way to get out of the Lair?
	- [ ] maybe not
- [ ] Third path contains the cages with trapped people, red clothing nearby
- [ ] Main room still has books to loot! or anywhere else
	- [ ] Sai finds Tagebuch of [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]]:
	- [ ] dated, stuff that happened before she met K'Var, research about Ruidium
	- [ ] maybe mention relationship between her and marcus
	- [ ] end with smth that new members are coming sharing interest, mostly good
	- [ ] only last part is with K'Var, then the notes end 
		- [ ] doesnt want [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Lafthal]] to release his research
- [ ] [[Bibbity Bobbity]] secret room:
	- way too large bed for one dwarf
	- lots of empty regale, ständer etc
	- Trap door under the bed
		- secret stash? -> infernal runes, has [[Black diamond + Scroll]] scroll in it 
- [ ] Wall of force item needs 4 actions total (one for each needle), and has limited uses, unknown rarity, maybe 
- [ ] [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] got 8x 25g of [[Ruidium]] crystals
- [ ] [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] afterlife scene...epilogue viewing his accomplishments, the warrior who never backed down
	- Since they have to wait at least 24h: let him experience this afterlife world, until it fades to memory of the attack
	- [ ] Play [HE COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVztswfde8) ?
		- "normally when people die you play a sad ost, but not for vorak 
		- [ ] Maybe prep his most Epic moments (HDWTDT) etc
		- [ ] Could also only play OST if he comes back...could make quantum and play regardless
			- [ ] "The one who does not give up, does not yield, never bends a knee...his task is not yet fulfilled"
			- [ ] In this moment the divine magic was only spark...as he himself rages himself back to being alive
				- [ ] You remember back...back to when your parents died before you...you remember the feeling you had....THE RAGE that consumed you....a small memory returns to you...
				- [ ] That you werent saved that day...no one protected you...you died with the next attack...
				- [ ] But the rage carried on...it carried on...you see a glimpse of the champion nodding...and then waking again...from this moment on having silver eyes and constant voices that haunt you to this day....
	- [ ] Maybe ask first if he accepts that he in fact lost and died or if he refuses to accept that fact
		- [ ] "What next step will vorak take, a step towards divinity leaving his rage behind or will he go back to that one moment where he lost everything, too his roots as a Stormheart"
		- [ ] Or accept death as this final moment 
		- [ ] Or reject it and take the full help of your friend
			- [ ] maybe feat that gives bonus when getting the "help" action
			- [ ] or "For my friends" 
	- [ ] Could give custom ability "Rage beyond death"
		- "While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious.  You can't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points."
		- maybe any additional hit increases RC by one?
	- [ ] If he chooses aceptence he can swap is babarian class for paladin with strength as modifier

- [ ] Complete [[Xal'thul]] statblock!

- [ ] Maybe [[The Judge]] wants to kill his brother (Leader of [[The Veil]]) -> get control, he is doing stupid things


- [ ] Next Session 0:
	- [ ] Want a party working with each other not against
	- [ ] I want that each players know what the others intentions are with the character, its easier to fit yours in. Not like last time where everyone is isolated


- [ ] Unused [[Aboleth (Alyxian)#Telepathic Messages]] go to dialogue in [[Netherdeep]]!!

- [ ] If they kill [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] and cant get the info on [[Ruidium research mission|Laftals failed mission]]:
	- [ ] Have [[Marcus Lianosa|Marcus]] have his Journal (or somebody elses) in the [[Netherdeep]]

- [ ] Maybe put out statement of any sidequest or thing they want to do, to tell me
- [ ] Could design "We lost" moment
	- [ ] maybe the judge is out to get his family back
