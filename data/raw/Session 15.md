## Session Start
- Kenshi’s patron hat figured out that the connection to him had been growing stronger throughout the journey and now that he is in [[Bazzoxan]], it is even possible for him to contact him directly.
- Eve, or Ivella, had a conversation with her mother “[ [Vaelistra Zaphyr|Visenya Telass] ]”, which Aurora was also able to overhear due to a nat 20 on Stealth.
	- She mentioned plans regarding [[Xal'thul]] and Ivella/her friends, as well as other family Connections (which the others do not yet know).
	- Eve was too intimidated to speak up on her own.
	- “Visenya” knew that someone else was present but did not react to it.
	- Meanwhile, [[Callimar Despana]] was distracted by Melli.
- Group conversation 
	- Eve revealed that her mother is part of the so-called [[Children of Malice]], who worship Lolth, the Spider Queen, a Betrayer God.
	- She herself has (supposedly) turned away from them and was on the run.
	- This explained the assassins and her reaction in the cave where you found a Children of Malice hideout.
- Afterwards, the group met [[Essek Thelyss]], the “Shadowhand” of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], who brought them into a room containing one of the [[The Luxon|Luxon]] Beacons.
	- [[Abrianna Mirimm]] attempted to help [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] recover his memories through the process of [[Consecution|Anamnesis]], but it did not work.
	- She spoke of two veiled connections.
	- Kenshi surrendered himself to the Luxon but was hesitant at first and needed encouragement from his patron.
	- You stood face to face with your past “self” and saw many others you had no memories of.
	- You heard countless voices; it was unclear whom or what you were communicating with, but before you broke the connection to the Luxon, you were told: “You are a victim of his plans.”
- [[Verin Thelyss]] assassination attempt
	- You told Verin about Visenya’s true intentions and convinced him to question her because of it, and through Essek you learned more about [[Xal'thul]], the [[Xal'thul|Hope Devourer]].
	- After [[Essek Thelyss]] showed Aurora his [[Graviton Lance(Lanze)]], you went to wait in the canteen to see if anything would happen at all.
	- ...until Visenya and Callimar actually attempted to kill him.
		- The two of them apparently already expected to be confronted and caught [[Verin Thelyss]] by surprise.
	- Massive chaos followed; both of them escaped, but not before Visenya did what she had promised Eve: to kill her friends.
		- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] died
	- A large number of soldiers chased after them, including [[Question]], but you were focused on Kenshi and bringing him back to life.

			- "Nun können wir unseren Pact erweitern"...skull flies down, body not shown
				- "Versprichst du mir deine Seele nach deinem Tot?"
					- If Not: "Ich kann dich noch stärker machen, dass soll es doch wert sein?"
			- "Aber unsere Verbindung ist immer noch nicht stark genug, begib dich in den [[Betrayers rise]] dort können wir uns...persönlich sehen"
		- Why he let him die
			- [x] Was kann ich dafür wenn du nicht stark genug warst zu überleben oder wenigstens mit mir zu kommunizieren
			- [x] Du beendest die Verbindung mit dem Luxon aber hast mir noch nicht deine Seele anvertraut, das ist Gefährlich

			- [ ] "Sie stehen nicht mir zu, auch ich gebe sie nur weiter" ->
		- If he mentions negative past memories
			- [ ] "Hört sich an als wärst du einen Pact eingegangen den du nicht ganz Verstanden hast. Und dich jemandem unterworfen den du eigentlich gar nicht unterstützt."
				- [ ] (secret) "Du hast mir alles angeboten für deine enormen Kräfte, ich habe von dir genommen und dir gegeben."
		- Why does he know so much
			- [ ] "Ich habe andere...Diener...die mir Informationen bringen"
		- Erweiterter Pact
			- [x] "Was dich gerade zurück hält ist deine Waffe...ich habe eine neue für dich. Keine Sorge sie kann die gleiche Form annehmen wie deine jetzige."
			- [x] "Sie befindet sich in [[Bazzoxan]]...aber ich glaube der Name hat sich über die Jahre geändert,  jetzt heißt er [[Betrayers rise]]"
			- Seele/Wiederbelebung
				- is the same, he will allow him to come back to life
			- Wie finde ich den Raum/Waffe?
				- "Ich werde dich leiten, keine sorge du wirst die richtige Tür finden"
			- Frage zu Waffe Stärke
				- [x] "Umso näher du mir stehst umso stärker wird sie sein. 
				- [x] (maybe don't) Die Seelen helfen aber ich brauche das versprechen deiner Seele um dir noch mehr Kräfte zu geben"
		- Extra: If he asks how to redeem himself
			- "Du hast nichts falsch gemacht, es ging um Leben und tut. Du denkst doch auch nicht über all die drow nach,  die du im Krieg getötet hast"
			- "Aber wenn du Erlösung/Redemption suchst, werde stärker, beherrsche die Kräfte die ich dir gebe, dann wirst du niemals wieder gezwungen sein jemanden zu töten. Und du kannst jeden beschützen der dir am Herzen liegt."
			- Future: ("Ich kann dir noch so viel mehr geben aber ich bin limitiert durch meine...Gefangenschaft....und Absenz von Körper. Wenn du mir hilfst das zu ändern dann..."
