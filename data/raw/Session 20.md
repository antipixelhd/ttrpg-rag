# Planning
### Organisatorisches
- [ ] Kleiner Checkup: Frage ob ihr mit der derzeitigen Gruppen situation zurecht kommt und die okay ist
	- Wir erzählen eine gemeinsame Geschichte
	- Speziell die tension in der Gruppe (Melli/Kenshi/Vorak vs Sai/Eve/Aurora)
		- Entweder euren Charactern ist es egal
		- Oder es ist ihnen nicht egal aber euch interessiert solche interaction zu roleplayen und diese zu überkommen (sich zu beweisen / rauzureden etc)
		- Oder ihr habt keine lust drauf und dann hören die anderen auf 
		- (kann sich auch noch umentscheiden)
- [ ] Important talk about good/evil + kenshi confrontation/conflict
	- [ ] Andere fragen wenn ihr euch nicht sicher seid
	- [ ] actual ernster conflict, soll behandelt werden. Grundsätzlich durch roleplay nicht pvp
	- [ ] Mir sagen wenn euch was nicht gefällt oder nicht wollt das etwas passiert oder nicht sicher seid bei etwas
- [x] SELF: Make Strichliste to track how many times each one got hit/attacked
	- add reminder to let [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / Eve have successes -> fail saves for monsters!!
	- reminder: NAT 1 saving throw!! -> Lots of rolling today!!
	- current time 4:00
	- write down everyones HP to track?!?
	- use ring markers for cursed -> [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] could be clutch
- [x] Exhaustion reminder -> use ring markers!
- [x] [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] roll d100 if flashlight breaks! 15
---
- [ ] Don't make negative assumptions about player interpretations -> STAY POSITIVE -> Have fun!!!
- [ ] Do Whispers
- [ ] Describe more senses
- [ ] Describe age of NPCs
# Session Start
- Three possible paths to go
	- Looked at mist pit, [[Question]] heard voices of her friends
		- Vorak stopped her from jumping down
		- Everyone saw seltsames lila leuchten down, but didnt pursue it
	- looked at lava cave and saw similar demon that killed Perigee
		- ran away
	- Went through the three tunnels, gained some exhaustion, always dark was the solution
		- lead to smaller cave clearing
		- found books and tagebuch von [[Isshkar the Burrowed]] (dem Vergrabenen)
		- Fought hands, aurora almost got dragged, Melli dived in and found portal to [[Far Realm]], acidic air
- Further walking 4h
- Past black chains, everyone made it except Gojo who died
- rested in front of tall doors, mit andauerndem weinen/heulen das aus dem nächsten Raum kommt
- To the Cathedral...
	- Everyone failed charisma except Kenshi 
	- Vorak failed wisdom save
# Timeline / Agenda
- [ ] [[Question]] reacts to the group!
	- [ ] (*if* she sees it again) confronts [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] because of gun -> praises her
	- [ ] Maybe asks what they did before, how they met?
- [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]] Vision options
	- Needs time to react -> [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] 
	- [x] Night time
	- [ ] After Finale
	- [ ] Leaving the Temple
## Night Time 
- [x] Do [[Alyxian Visions#Parents death (13th)]] Do another childhood memory?!?
- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] meditate instead of sleeping
	- ask what they are thinking about!
- [ ] [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] wanted to talk with [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] about [[Ruidium Corruption]] (Aids)
- [ ] [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] Albtraum -> mother talking, killing friends etc
- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]], [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver]], motivation
	- possibly roll d100 to find out what happens
	- scale of only feeling emotion/connection to a doorway appearing and him walking through
		- [!] Play Sai calm theme -> geige
		- location should be night, with Herbst setting (rot/braun/gelbe blätter), giant trees?
		- she appears as moon light floating down
			- -> he has to react first 
			- She motivate to believe in friends. But leaves choices to him!
## Loose Threads
- If [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] uses [[remove-curse]] on [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]: spellcasting check DC20:
	- If on Sword: removes attunement -> visual effects? 
	- Success: 
		- [i] Everyone leaves table 
		- fühlt zwei Präsenzen
		- kann entscheiden ob er zum Luxon oder zum Patron geht -> darkness oder light
		- Triggers him getting confronted with [[Xal'thul]]
		- Sees black humanoid husk with black tether into the abyss and grey comforting light
		- maybe [[Tharizdun]] teaser
	- Failure: 
		- knows there is some other presence, that you are not powerful enough to interact with
	- Regardless: knows there is no curse
- [[Kenshi Xal'thul Talk]]
- [x] [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] asking for more from [[Xal'thul]]
	- [[Xal'thul]] deal
		- confirm that this is serious business
		 1) Roll d20 + Charisma mod to decide strength, advantage if insane offering
			- 15 and higher: max strength
			- 5-15, save required from hydra
			- 1-4: doesn't work
		2) Take offering, roll d100 for lost/remaining years, or favor 
		3) "Animation" 
			- Appears
			- tries to teleport X away but needs more power -> [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] goes unconscious
			- "Hurl through Abyss" - effects depending on strength 
	- [[Xal'thul]] appearance -> **more complete!!** -> maybe see void chest -> [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] flashback (same amulet)
		- [i] Play The Mad Devil OST
		- [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] can hear voices from [[Xal'thul]] instead of [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]
		- [[Xal'thul]] says to [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]]: (consume soul feeling:) "Ah..dir wurde schon ein Teil genommen..vielleicht findet es ja noch seinen weg zu mir"

- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]]
	- Wie reagiert Melli auf den Gedanken andere "Menschen" zu töten?
