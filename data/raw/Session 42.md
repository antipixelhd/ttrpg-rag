		- And even After calling upon [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver]], no answer came
		- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] did not wake up
- Explanation of [[Ruidium Corruption]] mechanic:
	- From What you know:
		- Everyone has minor levels, and there major level thresholds 
		- Increasing the corruption Minor Level, increases the exhaustion by one up to the maximum allowed my the Major Level
		- Increasing the minor Level above the next Major level threshold increases the Major Level by one and therfore the maximum amount of exhaustion one can get from [[Ruidium Corruption]]
		- The only way known to decrease [[Ruidium Corruption]] is through the spell [[greater-restoration]]
			- Reduced the current minor levels back to the nearest major level threshold 
	- Sai/Melli are currently at Major level 0
		- Vorak/Eve are currently at Major level 1 -> max exhaustion is currently 1
