## Loose Threads
- If [[Ayo Jabe|Ayo]] loses the spear!
	- [[Xal'thul]] will demand [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] to destroy the spear
	- [[Xal'thul]] will force a Eldritch smite and will cast [[Banishing-Smite]] himself 
- [i] [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] x [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] / [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]] encounter
	- [i] maybe even [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]] who is interested in her inventions 
		- [i] Wants a way to have [[Ruidium]] items without the corruption
	- [i] Will stand in dark corner, face not visible
	- [i] -> if light shines could activate anti magic or charm her! 
- Magnet Lore:
	- magnets sometimes don't work around the [[Cerulean Palace]]! 
		- (400-600m range) 
		- Multiple times a day -> more towards the evening
		- its the [[cobalt-golem-tdcsr|Cobalt Golem]] ability -> have to activate it once per day for maintenance reason
- [ ] Nobody knows yet that the first [[The Luxon|Luxon]] was discovered after a certain person killed himself
- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] leaving the Party
	- [[Skyship]], reduced price if going to [[Port Damali]] via trade route(400g, instead of 4000g), takes two weeks
		- +400g directly to [[Zadash]], horse back would be another couple weeks of travel

	- [ ] Maybe [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] + [[Ayo Jabe|Ayo]] + [[Dermot Wurder|Dermot]] is present

		- He waited for him at the [[Wand der Unvergessenen]]
	- [x] Sendoff, after he leaves [[Ank'Harel]]
		- [i] Welchen Moment hat [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] am meisten verändert, welche Erinnerung will er nie vergessen und denkt sogar jetzt daran.
		- [i] Gibt es etwas was [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] bereut nicht getan oder gesagt zu haben. 
		- "Kenshi ist einen weiten Weg gekommen. Anfangs unwissend, blind der stimme folgend die im Stärke verspricht. 
		- Du hast den ""Fluch"" gebrochen der dich an das Luxon bindet, der erste Schritt um [[Xal'thul]] zu befreien.
		- Dann hast du [[Xal'thul]] selbst getroffen, einen neuen Pact mit ihm geschlossen und ihm die ganzen Seelen gegeben die er auf dem Weg gesammelt hat. 
			- Alles nur um den [[Betrayers rise]] zu überleben und die um dich zu schützen. Doch auch das war genau das was er wollte.
		- Du hast Erinnerungen von einem Vergangen Ich gesehen, die mehr Fragen offen gelassen haben anstatt sie zu beantworten.
			- Und zuletzt hast du dich noch einmal getroffen, er sprach von einem "gebrochen Zyklus", das niemand mehr von euch manipuliert wird, aber das es zu viel gekostet hat
		- [!] Play patron theme (bottom left)
		- Die Tage vergehen, die Verbindung zu [[Xal'thul]] ist gebrochen, und doch wird [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] von der Dunkelheit nicht losgelassen...
			- Eines Tages wird er realisieren welchen Preis er gezahlt hat, was die Worte von seinem Vergangen Ich bedeuten...
			- Eventuell ist es der Tag an dem sein Herz komplett aufhört zu schlagen, vielleicht aber auch schon früher. 
			- Der Pact ist erfüllt und wenn ihn niemand aufhält, wird der Hope Devourer wieder Auferstehen und die Epoche des Endes einleiten
- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] Ripping out eye:
	- Disadvantage on all perception and attack rolls!
	- Eye might survive and attack?
