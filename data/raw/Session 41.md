	- Fought [[death-embrace-custom|Death Embrace]], a huge jellyfish, warped by [[Ruidium]]
		- at one point three people went down
		- [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] got the killing blow
			- technically he earned the right to the [[ruidium-weapon-crcotn|Ruidium Greataxe]] but [[Selene Noctis (Til)|Selene]] interfered
				- Nat 20 in deception allowed for enough confusion, but [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] knew he got the killing blow!
				- In the end [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]], [[Ayo Jabe|Ayo]] and [[Dermot Wurder|Dermot]] left the [[ruidium-weapon-crcotn|Ruidium Greataxe]] to [[Main Party]]
		- Meanwhile [[Maggie Keeneyes|Maggie]] [[Irvan Wastewalker|Irvan]] and [[Galeokaerda]] used teleportation tablet to book it
			- [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] watched them as fish!
			- Found out they were talking to [[Larthul the Wolf|The Wolf]]
				- one from [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]], but who did sell out [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]]
			- [ ] what they dont know: [[Larthul the Wolf|The Wolf]] said something like "sadly we couldnt hide the key from the [[Allegiance of Allsight|Allegiance]], we will use one of our own"
- Wanted to destroy permanent teleportation at Royal library
	- because [[Galeokaerda]] mentioned it to [[Larthul the Wolf|The Wolf]]
- Went to Temple of the Arch Heart
	- Got rid of divine Barrier, Sai/Selene/Aurora/eve participated
	- Went inside temple, which was devoid of water
		- Saw a very old [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]] answer questions in this very temple 
	- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] hit [[Ruidium]] crystal to trigger the big vision
		- Everyone was in the city, trying to defend it
			- Orcs storming the city, attacking from the Jungle
			- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] flying and shooting a rain of arrows down
			- [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] throwing Towers into open holes
			- [[Selene Noctis (Til)|Selene]] assassinating everyone, and running on the outside of the walls
			- [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] using Final G as a mortar to rain down fireballs 
			- [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] being way bigger than he thought and running over and through the orcs
			- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] calling upon some kind of primal fire to burn masses of them
		- Alyxian doing his own part, then realizing there is a bigger threat on the horizon
			- [[Gruumsh, The Ruiner]] throwing his spear, infused with all his strength to destroy the entire continent
		- Alyxian parrying the spear, successfully?
			- Everything in a hundred kilometer radius got super heated 
			- The city sinking bellow the earth
		- You now know how the desert got created
	- [i] [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] wonders: Where were the other gods? Why did Alyxian have to confront [[Gruumsh, The Ruiner|Gruumsh]] alone? 
- Ended session at everyone
	- They went outside and brought a random humanoid statue to [[Allegiance of Allsight|Allegiance]], specifically [[Gryz Alakritos]]
