# Summary
- Ideas for til
	- He wanted to outsmart [[Xal'thul]], what changed?
		- interact with maze etc
	- Unexplored roleplay
		- Fathers teachings dynamic 
	- Immediate
		- resolving of why he took the power again
		- defining Relationship with Eve or Melli
	- General
		- Just interacting with the party, enabling others through roleplay
		- defining his mental state and where Til wants it to be
	- Motivations
		- what motivates kenshi -> explore that
	- Worst case
		- swap to backup char
- [[Treassure Hunt - Devossa's Lair]]
	- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] revealed black eye to everyone, later found out she can look into [[Ethereal Plane]] and maybe more?
	- Tried to go to secret path but blocked by door that can't be opened -> ruined the temple
	- Went to other side of temple and found sarcophages, didnt open, found picture of piercing the Eye of [[Gruumsh, The Ruiner]]
	- Found Treasure room
		- got big items
		- got attacked by brass golems and a DRAGON??
		- got everyone out but was close
	- [ ] Also architekten gefunden -> [[J'mon Sa Ord]] said they where responsible for the tower
	- Items found (add in dndbeyond)
		- [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] potion of growth, [[immovable-rod]]
		- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]], [[Doublet of Dramatic Demise]]
		- [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]], longsword (worth 750-1000G), + [[potion-of-superior-healing]], that he drank
			- Also +1 Shield, attunement: Cant be knocked prone (make it so when attuned it extends) -> add if he attunens "It gives the thrength to never have to bend the knee again "
		- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]: Warp Anchor with Nat 20
	- [ ] they did not open any of the Tombs
- [[J'mon Sa Ord]] talk
	- [i] Sai at start: it would be cool that at some point we can have such conversations fully in character. The more intense they are the more I will push on in character.
	- reveal that mirror leads to private chambers of the Rules of [[Ank'Harel]]
	- Top tower clouded
	- He was the one who watched their match against [[Kane]] from the Tower
	- Talked and convinced him [[Asmutayya]] let them have treasure
	- If they keep secret about anything that happened there, they get to keep treasure
	- [ ] They revealed [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream|Consortium]] and "Ella", showed black eye and [[Ruidium Corruption]] also showed [[Ruidium]] (Melli did)
		- he said he will inform the [[Cobalt Soul]]
		- maybe dont insta rush the [[First Eclipse (Taverne)]]!, tie into the quest
		- First have [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] reveal, then the decide if they want to keep eyes on consortium or not
	- [ ] He also revealed [[The Veil]], biggest crime syndicate in [[Ank'Harel]]
	- [ ] He asked for them to investigate more about the Magic weapons with red veins
- Played magic items the rest of the day
	- [ ] I added them into dnd beyond!
- Night Time
	- [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] casual reveal he can walk through walls, also [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] can look into the [[Ethereal Plane]]
	- [[Encounter - Melli Dream]]
		- Saw dead parents and herself chained to the metal desk
	- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] x [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver|Moon Weaver]] encounter
		- She is happy with what Sai is doing
		- (only mention if vision is not happening at the start:) Talked about that Sai should choose is own "Schicksal"
		- In the end said I am sorry as she touched Sai's shoulder, unclear to whom she said those words and even shed a tear
		- [ ] Sai asked about Ruidus: she only said she created Catha
			- Did not answer about [[Ruidus]] -> if they push further she will sai that they all created it, and its was the "first Mistake" of the Gods (Second was Aoer) -> she didnt want all that since it robs her children of the freedom of choice, she would have been happy to die
- Start with
	- [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] x [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] or when he returns
		- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] realizes tattoos -> added [[Moonweavers Touch]] FEAT!
	- [ ] maybe have [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]] vision at the start? or end of session?
	- [ ] after long rest exhaustion goes away and [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] / [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] are back to normal
- [ ] [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] gains inspo for getting that shield
- [ ] have [[J'mon Sa Ord]] encounter after the campaign where he thanks them for saving the city (if he finds out) -> reveals he is the dragon [[J'mon Sa Ord|Devo'ssa]]
- [ ] Could remove [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] black eye again because [[K'Var the Corrupted|K'Var]] is scared of being found out since [[J'mon Sa Ord]] is no involved
	- could now go away from [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream|Consortium]] being interested in melli as a experiment since it failed and more into why they have [[Ruidium]]
- [ ] maybe give Sai [[Moonweavers Touch]] upgrade because moonweaver touched him and said he should continue helping everyone
	- could have his hands engraved with white/blue tattoos/lines that signify the upgrade
- [ ] add to [[Ruidium]] lore: it is only similar because [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]] hated [[Ruidus]] and thats how it manifested (otherwise no connection)
- [ ] [[Vaelistra Zaphyr|Vaelistra]] will happen after next mission (if they have enough ressources)
	- [ ] add the roles to start of next day because they arrived
- [ ] Next day they will get call from [[Iwo Zalarre]] for next mission
	- [ ] maybe he mentions they are looking into [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream|Consortium]] and gathering evidence
- [ ] Maybe also add to [[Netherdeep]] creation lore: [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]] was shunted into the waterplane out of pure chance because of [[Gruumsh, The Ruiner]] spear. But there alone he created the prison because nobody saved him. Also because he partially wanted to loose.
- [ ] When Kenshi dies: ask "I dont think You answered the question from Eve. Do you want to live? -> play do you want to live as he expresses his dying moments (non epic version, epic version will play when they fight Xalthul to get his soul back!)"
	- then play Xalthul evil ost as he doesnt go into the afterlife and has to see the suffering [[Xal'thul]] will unleash upon the world
- [ ] Room layout
	- Melli + Vorak
	- Sai + Aurora
	- Kenshi + Eve
		- [ ] ask if they wanna roleplay a conversation?

- [ ] Kenshi new outfit mini?

- [ ] look into beholder lair, maybe have [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] and [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] be getting the feeling of "getting followed"
