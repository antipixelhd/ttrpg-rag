# Session Start
- After the fight with the demons (Ruins of Sorrow), you set out toward [[Bazzoxan]].
	- [[Kronin Duendalos]] helped you and recommended you to [[Verin Thelyss]].
	- You are now officially known as NSFW.
- First steps into [[Bazzoxan]], a run-down military city of the [[Aurora Watch]].
	- Surprised by fleshy demons with many mouths and eyes.
	- Ayo/Dermot/Irvan/Maggie made it to safety.
	- You also barely managed to reach safety and waited until the danger passed.
- First night in the Ready Room, a simple barn.
	- Aurora inspected the metal gauntlet and put it away again.
	- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] had a dream of two elves he saw underwater.
- The next day, you slept until noon and then headed toward the barracks.
	- You found a dwarf child, [[Sylphie]], in an alley, crying while holding her father’s helmet, and brought her to the barracks.
	- You spoke with the Taskhand [[Verin Thelyss]], who is responsible for all of [[Bazzoxan]].
		- He asked about your intentions and rewarded you with 1200 gold for your help at the [[Ruins of Sorrow]].
		- He explained that 50 years ago Abyssal Rifts were discovered in the [[Betrayers rise]] and that it is his and the [[Aurora Watch]]’s duty to stop the demons emerging from the [[Betrayers rise]].
		- He asked you to do him a favor and investigate what exactly the foreign researchers in [[Bazzoxan]] are planning:
			- An expedition of the [[Cobalt Soul]] is currently inside the [[Betrayers rise]] with an escort from the [[Aurora Watch]] to study battles of the Calamity that took place in its halls. One researcher turned back early and returned.
			- An elf named Aloysia from the [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]], who has repeatedly tried to bribe soldiers of the [[Aurora Watch]].
			- A [[Prolix Yusaf|Prolix]] from the [[Allegiance of Allsight]], who supposedly supports the arcanists of the [[Aurora Watch]] searching for ways to seal the Abyssal Rifts in the [[Betrayers rise]]. However, a specialist in dimensional rifts from [[Rosohna]] is also currently in [[Bazzoxan]], and she has never heard of a [[Prolix Yusaf|Prolix]].
	- You took part in a shooting contest against an orc. Kenshi won, but Vorak hit every shot.
		- You were also offered the chance to compete further against members of the [[Aurora Watch]] (wrestling and sparring) and to eat for free in the canteen.
- You made your way back to the central watchtower and met [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] again, who was just coming from the [[Ready Room]].
	- (The plan was to stop by the [[Infirmary]].)
	- [I] You see that farther to the north, a long, massive staircase has been built into the mountains, leading up to the enormous gates of the [[Betrayers rise]].
