# start

	- Ritual failing with the IMPOSSIBLE NAT 1!!!!

- [ ] maybe flesh out more what happened at [[Ruidium research mission|Laftals failed mission]] from outside POV, things they could learn if they asked/searched, other than [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]]


- [ ] look into beholder lair, maybe have [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] and [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] be getting the feeling of "getting followed"
