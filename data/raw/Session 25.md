# Planning
## Organisatorisches
- [ ] if it comes up [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] doesn't know how old he is or was!! -> was at least 15 when he woke up
- [x] Current time: 15:00
- [x] Reminder for insight checks:
	- Not forced to believe something if you have reason to doubt 
		- example: random guy pot lying vs [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] who lies a lot
	- Also used to understand mannerism and pot gain more info
- [x] Can always summarize events for chars that weren't present but the players were!!
	- roleplay important if you have something to add
		- lying, or mannerism/emotions
		- extra details 
	- (Example last session [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] telling [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] what [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] told them, etc)
- [ ] Guide for improvising
	- Never say straight "No", rather do "no but"
		- casually think about it, 
		- good guideline for roleplaying with each other
	- Example: Me saying no to Brunnen but yes there was a bucket near

---
- [ ] Don't make negative assumptions about player interpretations -> STAY POSITIVE -> Have fun!!!
- [ ] Do Whispers
- [ ] Describe more senses
- [ ] Describe age of NPCs
