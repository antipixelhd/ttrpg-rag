		- He saw memories of a past life in which he took part in the last great battle of the [[Betrayers rise]], fighting on the side of the demons.
		- You decided to resist and tried to stop, and the past body wanted the same, but it was futile - your willpower was too weak.
		- While a kind of leader flew above you on his drake, you moved toward [[Alyxian the Apotheon|Alyxian]]. Just before you could strike the first blow, your memories jumped forward in time.
		- You were completely alone in the ruins of [[Bazzoxan]] and finally felt a sense of freedom. With your last strength, you wanted to atone for your sins and killed yourself.
		- Yet a part of you was still bound to the darkness. You saw thousands of souls falling with you.
		- Until a grayish light suddenly stopped the fall and pulled you toward it.
- [[Verin Thelyss]] explained [[Consecution|Anamnesis]] and [[Consecution]]
	- Consecution is the ritual that binds a soul to the Luxon. If someone who is consecuted dies, they are reborn.
