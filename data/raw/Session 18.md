- [ ] Do Whispers
- [ ] Describe more senses
- [ ] Describe age of NPCs
## Session Start
- Gang voller Messer überstanden -> Opfergabe für den Crawling King
- Seltsamer Raum voller Federn die in die Wand gezeichnet wurden und einen Altar in der Mitte
	- Long rested, Melli hat eine Münze aus der Schüssel auf dem Altar genommen
	- [i] say recovered Exhaustion
- Centrale Große Kammer
	- Musik hat den Raum erfüllt und ihr wurdet von Menschenartigen Flammen zum Tanzen aufgefordert
	- War nötig um die Bunte Mosaik Glaswand zu öffnen -> (Symbole der Betrayer Götter in richtige reinfolge auswählen) -> Sai speed solved it
	- [[Vorak Stormheart (Lars)|Vorak]] wollte brute forcen -> hätte auch geklappt aber hätte weh getan xD
- Kenshi/Vorak auf ein par Landminen gestellt
	- Melli die von Kenshi übernommen und Misty step
	- Aurora hat Vorak mit dem dimensional sword slice weg teleport
- Nächster Raum, Weißer Teufel der eine Drachen Gottheit verehrte
	- Erste Fight der durch intimidation beendet wurde (Kenshi)
	- Melli wurde mit ner nat1 persuasion nicht ernst genommen und hat seine Gottheit beleidigt
	- Kenshi wurde in eine Pit trap gezogen in dem Flammen loderten -> Kein problem mit resistance und fly
- Wo wir aufgehört haben
	- Hohe 5 eckige Kammer betreten in der in der Mitte haufenweise Silber/Bronze/Gold lag
	- Von einer Stimme aufgefordert euren "Tribut zu zahlen"
	- In der Mitte stand Text auf Draconic: *"Häufe Reichtum an aber gebe wenig aus"*
	- Bis dann eine Riesige Hydra mit 5 Drachenköpfen in den Raum geflogen ist
	- Ihr habt lange gebraucht bis jeder all sein Geld abgegeben hat was sie schon ziemlich Wütend gemacht hat -> Kenshi hat ein Platinum stück genommen was dann zu viel war
	- Der zweite von drei Texten sagt: *"Keine Beleidigung darf ungestraft bleiben"*
- Fight
	- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] hat 1,5m x 1,5m Loch in Steinwand gemacht
	- Hydra und die Statuen im Raum haben euch angegriffen
	- Aurora hat ihre Schuhe benutzt um Vorak zu heilen und zu entkommen

# Start
- Melli voulnerable to radiant (+1d4 necrotic), Aurora half healing (1d4 poison)
- Vorak +1d4 fire
- the legendary action should be round based instead of dracohydra focused ->  round nothing happened yet
	- [i] tell everyone! question didn't get hit yet!
- [ ] Vorak is down but stable, Sai should be still unconsious, til has bane (white is concentrating)
- [ ] Track Hits!! maybe write everyone hp?
- [ ] Hydra should focus kenshi with multi attack
# Timeline
- [ ] [[Question]] reacts to the group!
	- [ ] (if she sees it again) confronts [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] because of gun -> praises her
	- [ ] Maybe asks what they did before, how they met?
	- [x] [[Blade of broken mirrors]]
- [ ] Incorporate way to use maze amulet -> maybe suggest just using it and thinking of place
	- also ask what everyone is doing -> traps might appear
- [ ] Add situation/room to watch a lot of demons (maybe later)
## Night Time 
- [ ] Do [[Alyxian Visions#Parents death (13th)]]? 
- [ ] [[Question]] -> drinks alcohol to sleep
- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] meditate instead of sleeping
	- ask what they are thinking about
- [ ] [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] wanted to talk with [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] about [[Ruidium Corruption]] (Aids)
- [ ] [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] Albtraum -> mother talking, killing friends etc
- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]], [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver]], motivation
	- possibly roll d100 to find out what happens
	- scale of only feeling emotion/connection to a doorway appearing and him walking through
		- [!] Play Sai calm theme -> geige
		- location should be night, with Herbst setting (rot/braun/gelbe blätter), giant trees?
		- she appears as moon light floating down
			- -> he has to react first 
			- She motivate to believe in friends. But leaves choices to him!
# Lore on [[Maroon 5|Maroon 5]] member
 - Saw massive demon with multiple hands and spherical head that had hundrets of eyes
 - Wanted to take other way and got teleported a bunch, its only time based
 - maybe already infected with [[Ruidium]] -> [[Aloysia Telfan|Aloysia]] promised cure
## Loose Threads
- If [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] uses [[remove-curse]] on [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]: spellcasting check DC20:
	- If on Sword: removes attunement -> visual effects? 
	- Success: 
		- [i] Everyone leaves table 
		- fühlt zwei Präsenzen
		- kann entscheiden ob er zum Luxon oder zum Patron geht -> darkness oder light
		- Triggers him getting confronted with [[Xal'thul]]
		- Sees black humanoid husk with black tether into the abyss and grey comforting light
		- maybe [[Tharizdun]] teaser
	- Failure: 
		- knows there is some other presence, that you are not powerful enough to interact with
	- Regardless: knows there is no curse
- [[Kenshi Xal'thul Talk]]
## NPCs
- [[Kronin Duendalos]]
- [[Sylphie]] -> Father [[Aderik]]
- [[Vuzur]]
- Berrain
	- Guard of [[Verin Thelyss]]
	- Can use [[zone-of-truth]] and [[charm-person]]
## Treasure
- [r] Silberner Ring mit einem kleinen Saphir, eingraviert "Irvan Wastewalker" und Wappen (250g, don't know that)
- [r] [[Ruidium]] 50g = 500gp
	- Rotes Mineral -> schwarz/dunkelrote Schlieren (sieht wie Blut aus)
	- Glatt/Ölig (Wie Obsidian/Jadeit)
	- Magic present

- Stormrider Boots (owned but not repaired)
	- Used her own Leather boots
		- Further: Find element to infuse for damage
		- Effect: uses air to propell 
- [r] Black diamond - cursed, nobody wants it, maybe unlocks door in [[Betrayers rise]]
	- gets warmer
	- Cant give it away, maybe later forced to eat it?
- Minor Loot
	- Drei bunte Ringe (2gp each) -> from the Vrock belly
- Screwdriver 
	- "pristine polished metal, with three ring to spin on handle"
		- First ring: changes type, second ring: changes instrument within type, third ring: changes specifications of instrument
	- Lore: Tool used by Artificers during the Age of Arcanum (quite common)
- Aurora Flashlight -> runs on temp battery, still needs 2h of work
	- each day additive chance that it breaks? (roll d100)
# Summary

- [ ] [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] destroyed the gravity crystal and put a shard into the [[Wand der Unvergessenen]]

- [ ] make some kind of table that decides how much hp [[Maroon 5|Maroon 5]] has, should depend amount of short/long rests in the dungeon
- [ ] or Future: only tell [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] about potential level up, 


- [ ] Idea for kenshi offering
	- If Til doesnt specify maybe just let it work or roll (without him telling what he sacrificed)
		- maybe let kenshi fall unconcious as additional price depending on roll (after [[Xal'thul]] appeared, not to say he came out of kenshi)
	- What he wants
		- He wants a "favor"
		- He wants him to stay behind
		- Remaining years of his life -> could roll d100 for how many years he looses
	- In return
		- Maybe roll d100 for strength
		- Could appear and teleport Hydra for one round away
		- Could focus the attention away from party/nullify attacks
	- Favor
		- could be later receiving souls 
		- could be instant betrayal and forces kenshi to stay behind
			- He would almost certainly insta die, bad because no party conversation
- [ ] if [[Question]] goes to the edge of the cliff, she will say: "I can hear them...(walks closer) they are down there (walks closer)...I am sure....(jumps)"
- [ ] no more healing potions -> give some to [[Cobalt Soul]] expedition (most are smashed)
- Finished Hydra
	- Everyone escape -> Clutch Eve stasis to prevent reactions
- Aurora didn't want to give the diamond away - tension
- Followed stairs deeper into the Betrayers Rise
- Entered a "library" with strange green crystal, wanting to know secrets
	- Sai admitted his believes in Sehanine are wavering and wants to know his past
	- Got the response that "I know all secrets", but didnt engage further
- Through a small mirror puzzle into the blood room with two demonic orcs.
- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] talked with Sai and motivated him (insane roleplay) to keep believing
- 3 way split on ways to go
	- Crawlway that leads to 3 colored ways -> Eve/Melli gained exhaustion
	- One way that's rather close leading to silver mist and the same voices calling out to jumo
	- last way leading to a natural cavern that's lighted and very hot
- [ ] Sai/Aurora wrote letter to Shandri/Chobeg
