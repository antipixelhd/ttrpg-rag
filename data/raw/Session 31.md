# Start
- Ended at
	- [[Vrill, the Moth|Vrill]] teleporting away with someone
	- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] down, [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] untouched
		- [i] A thought: was she ever important or relevant, or was everything a setup for this Moment
	- Question remains, who really are your parents, and who is "Er"
	- [x] Redcon insight check with advantage for [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]]: 
		- Maybe write Start on DC: Melli is unique in this group that she is  one of the few who knows true parental love. She keeps running away from the thought of facing what happened to her parents but deep down (maybe unknowingly) she longs for them and wants them back, wants their love back...So for a moment, when Sai hugged Vrill you see it in her eye, the look of a loving mother to her child.

		- "Kenshi ist einen weiten Weg gekommen. Anfangs unwissend, blind der stimme folgend die im Stärke verspricht. 
		- Du hast den ""Fluch"" gebrochen der dich an das Luxon bindet, der erste Schritt um [[Xal'thul]] zu befreien.
		- Dann hast du [[Xal'thul]] selbst getroffen, einen neuen Pact mit ihm geschlossen und ihm die ganzen Seelen gegeben die er auf dem Weg gesammelt hat. 
			- Alles nur um den [[Betrayers rise]] zu überleben und die um dich zu schützen. Doch auch das war genau das was er wollte.
		- Du hast Erinnerungen von einem Vergangen Ich gesehen, die mehr Fragen offen gelassen haben anstatt sie zu beantworten.
			- Und zuletzt hast du dich noch einmal getroffen, er sprach von einem "gebrochen Zyklus", das niemand mehr von euch manipuliert wird, aber das es zu viel gekostet hat
		- [!] Play patron theme (bottom left)
		- Die Tage vergehen, die Verbindung zu [[Xal'thul]] ist gebrochen, und doch wird [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] von der Dunkelheit nicht losgelassen...
			- Eines Tages wird er realisieren welchen Preis er gezahlt hat, was die Worte von seinem Vergangen Ich bedeuten...
			- Eventuell ist es der Tag an dem sein Herz komplett aufhört zu schlagen, vielleicht aber auch schon früher. 
			- Der Pact ist erfüllt und wenn ihn niemand aufhält, wird der Hope Devourer wieder Auferstehen und die Epoche des Endes einleiten
