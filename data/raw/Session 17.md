# Session Start
- Nach short rest in den [[Betrayers rise]] aufgemacht, entschieden der [[Cobalt Soul]] expedition zu folgen
	- [[Question]] hat geholfen
- Raum voller Augen mit einem Abgrund der nach euch gerufen hat, Tür die durch den Juwel geöffnet wurde. 
	- Juwel ist eine Vestige of Divergence, eines von vielen Legendären Gegenständen wo die meisten von Göttern erschaffen wurden. Sind zurückgeblieben als die Götter Exandria verlassen haben.
- Raum in dem die Statue von [[Zerxus Ilerez]] stand von dem man die Runde Kammer von der Box gesehen hat
- Dann einen Raum in denen ihr drei Wege hattet, eine Wand bei der euren Tot akzeptiert, einen Verschütteten gang freizuräumen oder was euch wichtig ist aufzugeben
	- [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] hat katana aufgegeben
	- Wesen aus Schatten und Rauch erschienen, Vorak/Sai wollten Kenshi aufhalten, Melli war auf Kenshis seite
		- [[Xal'thul]] reveal, [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] hat euch versichert das er auf eurer Seite ist
	- Wolltet nichts weiteres Aufgeben und seid durch die Wand geschritten 
		- -> Kenshi hat disadvantage auf death saves!
		- deaf hallway -> Room of Crawling King -> Fight gegen 3x Flameskulls 
# **Start**
- Didn't explore the other room
- undead presence is still there, add that they are very slowly regenerating
- Eve just read wants written on the stone floor
# Timeline

- [ ] [[Question]] reacts to the group!
	- [ ] (if she sees it again) confronts [[Aurora (Jason)|Aurora]] because of gun -> praises her
	- [ ] Maybe asks what they did before, how they met?
- [x] Changes depending on choices:
	- Skip R10 regardless
	- If they skip R8: Move Tiamat chamber before Tiamat boss
- [ ] Incorporate way to use maze amulet -> maybe suggest just using it and thinking of place
	- also ask what everyone is doing -> traps might appear
- [ ] Add situation/room to watch a lot of demons (maybe later)
- [x] [[Xal'thul]] says
	- "Ich brauche keine Seelen mehr von dir, es reicht wenn du den Dolch bei dir trägst"
## Night Time 
- [ ] [[Question]] -> drinks alcohol to sleep
- [x] [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]], describe evil atmosphere, evil gods influence, nothing good here
- [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] meditate instead of sleeping
	- ask what they are thinking about
- [x] Was denkt sich oder fühlt er Kenshi das er sein Familienerbstück hergegeben hat für die neue Waffe?
	- Deep down spürst du eine Kälte, eine Leere in dir, die davor noch nicht da war. Aber sie erinnert dich an Erinnerungen von deinem vergangenen Ich, an Einsamkeit und Hilflosigkeit.
	- Maybe dreams of Light/Luxon
- [ ] [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] wanted to talk with [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] about [[Ruidium Corruption]] (Aids)
- [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]], [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver]], motivation
	- possibly roll d100 to find out what happens
	- scale of only feeling emotion/connection to a doorway appearing and him walking through
		- [!] Play Sai calm theme -> geige
		- location should be night, with Herbst setting (rot/braun/gelbe blätter), giant trees?
		- she appears as moon light floating down
			- -> he has to react first 
			- She motivate to believe in friends. But leaves choices to him!
## Loose Threads
- If [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] uses [[remove-curse]] on [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]]: spellcasting check DC20:
	- If on Sword: removes attunement -> visual effects? 
	- Success: 
		- [i] Everyone leaves table 
		- fühlt zwei Präsenzen
		- kann entscheiden ob er zum Luxon oder zum Patron geht -> darkness oder light
		- Triggers him getting confronted with [[Xal'thul]]
		- Sees black humanoid husk with black tether into the abyss and grey comforting light
		- maybe [[Tharizdun]] teaser
	- Failure: 
		- knows there is some other presence, that you are not powerful enough to interact with
	- Regardless: knows there is no curse
- [[Kenshi Xal'thul Talk]]
## NPCs
- [[Kronin Duendalos]]
- [[Sylphie]] -> Father [[Aderik]]
- [[Vuzur]]
- Berrain

		- Further: Find element to infuse for damage
		- Effect: uses air to propell 
- [r] Black diamond - cursed, nobody wants it, maybe unlocks door in [[Betrayers rise]]

- Minor Loot
	- Drei bunte Ringe (2gp each) -> from the Vrock belly
- Screwdriver 
	- "pristine polished metal, with three ring to spin on handle"
		- First ring: changes type, second ring: changes instrument within type, third ring: changes specifications of instrument
	- Lore: Tool used by Artificers during the Age of Arcanum (quite common)
- Aurora Flashlight -> runs on temp battery, still needs 2h of work
	- each day additive chance that it breaks? (roll d100)
# Summary

- [ ] [[Galsariad Ardyth|Galsariad]] destroyed the gravity crystal and put a shard into the [[Wand der Unvergessenen]]

- [ ] make some kind of table that decides how much hp [[Maroon 5|Maroon 5]] has, should depend amount of short/long rests in the dungeon
- [ ] or Future: only tell [[Melantha (Melli) (Daniel)|Melli]] / [[Kenshi Takahashi (Til)|Kenshi]] about potential level up, 
- [ ] [[Eve-thra Arryn (Alina)|Eve]] can still change prepared spells
- [ ] next time [[Sai Nailo - (Karl)|Sai]] meditation [[Sehanine, The Moon Weaver]] might show up!
- [ ] eve used 3x level 1 slots, nothing else
- [ ] Idea for kenshi offering
	- What he wants
		- He wants a "favor"
		- He wants him to stay behind
	- In return
		- Maybe roll d100 for strength
		- Could appear and teleport Hydra for one round away
		- Could focus the attention away from party/nullify attacks
	- Favor
		- could be later receiving souls 
		- could be instant betrayal and forces kenshi to stay behind
			- He would almost certainly insta die, bad because no party conversation
- Did Crawling king trap
	- dispell magic worked on skull
	- had to move because of others regenerating
- Strange room with bunch black feathers and some kind of altar
	- Schüssel
	- long rested -> +1Day, current time 7:30
	- Melli found some nice gamba coin -> already tried to regain one charge today, has 1 currently
- Way to some kind central chamber, melli/kenshi/aurora danced
	- Sai solved puzzle
	- Other 
	- way back + verschütterter weg
- Traps on path, hit vorak/kenshi
	- melli took over for kenshi and misty stepped
	- aurora teleportet vorak to safety
- Next room with devil worshipping evil dragon goddess
	- relatively easy fight, ended with melli insulting and kenshi getting dragged into trap -> fire pit 
	- Melli voulnerable to radiant (+1d4 necrotic), Aurora half healing (1d4 poison)
	- Vorak +1d4 fire
- Entered big chamber with dracohydra demanding gold, everything,
	- Read first tenet
	- offered everything and secret exit opened but kenshi grabbed 1 platinum to trigger fight (was already pissed because it took so long)
	- kenshi made 1,5 x 1,5m hole
	- Aurora used boots
- For tracking
	- the legendary action should be round based instead of dracohydra focused ->  round nothing happened yet
	- [ ] tell everyone question didnt get hit yet
	- Vorak is down but stable, Sai should be still unconsious, til has bane (white is concentrating)
- [ ] Track Hits!! maybe write everyone hp?
- [ ] [[Xal'thul]] told kenshi he doesnt need souls
- [ ] Hydra should focus kenshi with multi attack
